            <p>
                I'm a first-year PhD student in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
                (UIUC). I am "watched" by my advisor <a href="https://tianyin.github.io/">Tianyin Xu</a>.
                <br />
                <br />
                My research explores practical AI and agent techniques for
                safety-critical computer systems and infrastructures. 
                My current work is in the AIOps space, specifically in AI for Site Reliability Engineering.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the past, I worked at NASA in the Space Technology Mission Directorate, where
                I helped develop space systems for the International Space Station. 
                I'm also an instructor at the Discovery Partners Institute at the
                University of Illinois, where I teach a professional development class on Data Science to CPS high school teachers.
